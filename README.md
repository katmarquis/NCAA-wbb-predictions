# NCAA-wbb-predictions
Project on predicting the outcomes of Division 1 NCAA women's basketball games for the class BEM/Ec 120 at Caltech. Feature engineered advanced statistics, visualized data, implemented feature selection, and coded a machine learning model in Python using Kaggle women's data. Achieved a 76% accuracy out of sample using a Decision Tree. The models were then used on men's data for comparison with the results from the women's models.
